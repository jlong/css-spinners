Simple CSS loading indicators made with CSS and minimal HTML markup.

![screenshot](http://f.cl.ly/items/033Q0Q202X430L1S2Z0A/css-spinners.png)

All loading indicators are designed to be used with minimal markup:

```html
<div class="loading-indicator">
	Loading...
</div>
```

Simply replace "loading-indicator" with the class name of your choice.

Markup
------

To use a specific loading indicator link the appropriate file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/spinner/throbber.css">
```

Or, if you'd like to have access to the entire library of spinners you can link the root file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/spinners.css">
```

Then apply the appropriate [class name](#class-names) for the spinner of your choice to the markup:

```html
<div class="throbber-loader">
	Loading...
</div>
```
